This repo describes how to set my mirrors for Arch or Gentoo, and also show how to create a mirror for these.
Specifics things to know about my server where is the mirrors : 

- 1Gbits bandwith fiber edition.
- 2 Tb stockage allowed (actually uses only 480Gb).
- 2 CPU / 1G RAM (it's sooo fine).
- Refresh every 4 hour for Gentoo and each hour for Arch.
- HTTPS only (Rsync todo).
- No-log policies, I don't care what you download.
- Uses Debian 11 üí™üèª.
- 100% French and Weeb powered (maybe not so cool).
- ‚ö† Arch mirror is not usable now ‚ö†


 Please don't hesitate to tell me if you use my mirror, so I can improve it if there is more and more users.
 You can also contribute to modify the `readme.md` file, translate it or make me any feedback and suggestions.
