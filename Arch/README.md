This repo describes how to set my mirror in your Arch system, and also show how to create a mirror.

Please don't hesitate to tell me if you use my mirror, so I can improve it if there is more and more users.
You can also contribute to modify the `readme.md` file, translate it or make me any feedback and suggestions.

## Set Juline to default mirror for Pacman

It's pretty simple because you only need to edit one file. 
Take your favorite editor and edit the `mirrorlist` located in `/etc/pacman.d/` :
```
nano /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```
It's possible Reflector has already configured this file and added some "Server = <url>" lines, so just comment every "Server =" lines.
Otherwise it must be added, the placement does not matter but it must be placed at the beginning of the line :
```
Server = <url>
```
After you have the line required, you can change the value of the `Server` variable :
Change `<url>` to `https://arch.juline.tech/$repo/os/$arch` and you should have this :
```
Server = https://arch.juline.tech/$repo/os/$arch
```
Save your `mirrorlist` file and exit.

The mirror is now set, and will be used for any download from pacman now.
You can run `paru -Syyu` (if you have `paru` installed) or `pacman -Syyu` to refresh packages.

If you want to set your own mirror, please read below.

## Set up your own mirror

Please keep in mind that these kind of "personnal mirrors" use bandwith from Tier 2 mirror, and I don't encourage anyone to set a mirror like this one just for fun, or only for your personal usage. If there is not a lot of Arch mirrors in your area, there is no problem to create one, and it's recommended to submit your mirror to the Arch team. 

If you still want to continue even after this warning ...

### Requirements

- Bandwith : You need to have a minimum of 5 MBit/s upstream capacity on a permanent connection, the higher, the better.
- Storage : Hosting a mirror requires a minimum of 350 GiB available disk space.
- HTTP and/or HTTPS access to the site. RSYNC is also supported.
- I assume that you already have a web server in place.
- The Arch team recommends to sync from master every hours.
- `rsync`
- `cron` or any task scheduler.
- An Arch system to test your mirror.
- A loooot of time (depends on your connection)

### Initial fetch

This part may be the hardest and takes a lot of time.
Please choose a location where the mirror will be stored. 
Often, it's `/var/www/` or `/var/www/html/` with an `apache` setup.
In my case, I've chosen `/var/www/html/arch/`.

I also recommend to create a `VirtualHost` to redirect to my Arch directory.
It's useful when you have multiple website already installed on your server.
Read your web server manual to know how to set `VirtualHost`.

When your desired directory is configured and accessible, it's time to download EVERYTHING from a Tier 1 mirror who supports Rsync.
Actually, it takes up to 350Gb to download, so please be patient.

To fetch from a Rsync Tier 1 mirror to your desired directory (List of Tier 1 mirrors: https://archlinux.org/mirrors/tier/1/) :
```
rsync -av <tier 1 mirror supports Rsync> /var/www/html/arch/
```
Change `/var/www/html/arch/` to the location that you have chosen.
The `-v` argument can be skipped if you don't want verbose mode.

After this huge download, your mirror can be now set in `mirrorlist` file (see previous chapter).
Be careful, if you stop right here, your mirror will never be updated.

### Cron setup to refresh your mirror

The instruction below is for [`cron`](https://github.com/cronie-crond/cronie) usage, please refer to the manual if you use an another tool.

Create a new task in crontab :
```
crontab -e
```
To refresh every hours :
```
00 */1 * * * rsync -av <tier 1 mirror supports Rsync> /var/www/html/arch/
```
You can change `1` to whatever you want (ex : `3` to refresh every 3 hours).

Everything should be working now.

### Enhancement and bonus

#### Log :

I recommend to log your rsync task, to see what have been updated since last time : 

```
00 */1 * * * rsync -av <tier 1 mirror supports Rsync> /var/www/html/arch/ >> /home/user/log.txt
```
 #### Script for easy call :

I've created a script to run simple line in my cron task :

```
#!/bin/bash

rsync -av <tier 1 mirror supports Rsync> /var/www/html/arch/ >> /home/user/log.txt
```
to have in cron :

```
00 */4 * * * /home/juliiine/rsync_mirror.sh
```
#### Send a mail every time a refresh is completed :

For this, you can use a `postfix` server, but honestly there is moooore simple.
I use [Swaks](https://github.com/jetmore/swaks), a perl-based tool to send simple mail in things like script.
You need an real email address and the SMTP configuration from your provider.
I use an OVH email address to send me mail in my script.

An exemple of usage of Swaks (with OVH out server settings) :

```
swaks -t receiver@address.com -s ssl0.ovh.net:587 -tls -au arch@yourdomain.com -ap superpassword -f arch@yourdomain.com --body "The body of your mail" --h-Subject "Planified update is good" --attach /home/user/logofrsyncoutput.log
```

Feel free to fill an issue if you have suggestions about this page, or if you want to translate it in other languages.
I also like to know if you use this mirror as a daily driver to see how it can be improved.
